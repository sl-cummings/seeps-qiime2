--output-path demux-single-end.qza
##this converts your FASTA files into a qiime-formatted file (.qza)
##after input-path type the folder name where you keep your raw reads
##the format of the reads should be: .fastq file, with each file containing seq and quality
##each file represents one sample or sequencing lane, either forward (R1) or reverse reads (R2)
##this input format doesn't combine forward and reverse reads, only one direction

##with previous seep work the R2s were bad and made everything garbage, thus, single direction

qiime demux summarize \
--i-data demux-single-end.qza \
--o-visualization demux.qzv
##view by downloading file via CyberDuck and uploading it at https://view.qiime2.org/
##or if you're working in VirtualBox:
#qiime tools view demux.qzv
##this produces a qiime graph that shows you two things:
##1. number of reads in each sample
##2. a graph showing the quality of the read over the sequence
##using 2, you'll want to choose how much on each end to cut off, based on where the ends significantly decrease in quality
